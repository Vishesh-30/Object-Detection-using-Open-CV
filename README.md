This project aims to do real-time object detection through a Video or an Image using OpenCV and MobileNetSSD. The idea is to loop over each frame of the video stream, detect objects like Person, Car, MotorBike, TrafficLights, dog, cat etc. all the objects are in Labels.txt file which can be detected and band bound each detection in a box with their Names.
